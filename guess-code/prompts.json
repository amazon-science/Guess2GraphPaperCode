These proteins interact through phosphorylation, activation, and inhibition pathways: {var_names_str}. \n\nIn protein signaling networks, direct causal relationships occur when:\n- One protein directly phosphorylates another\n- One protein directly activates or inhibits another\n- Proteins are part of the same signaling cascade or pathway\n\nIdentify ALL possible direct causal connections between these proteins. Be comprehensive - it's better to include a potential relationship than miss one. Consider both direct biochemical interactions and regulatory relationships.

In biological networks, proteins often have multiple interactions. Consider all possible direct connections. Return your answer as a list of variable name pairs that have direct edges between them.
